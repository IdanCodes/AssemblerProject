# Assembler Project
This is my final project for the course (Systems Programming Lab)[https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20465.htm] in the Open University of Israel.
I took the course in the first semester of 2024 (2024א).

The instructions for this project were provided by the university, but the main goal was to build an assembler for a made up assembly language, in C.
